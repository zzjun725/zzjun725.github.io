## Design and Strategy Optimization of an Air Hockey Robot for Man-machine Battle ##
*Team co-Leader, Shanghai Jiao Tong University &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sept. 2019 - Present*

*Supervisor: Xinjun SHENG, Xinyi LE*
* **Mechanical Structure and Electronic Control System**

Designed a real-time vision capture system for the localization and trajectory prediction of the puck.  

Created a two-link parallel mechanism instead of an XY-axis cross slide to reduce cumulative error.

Proposed an S-curve acceleration algorithm to improve the stability of stepper speed control.
* **Algorithm**

Modeled the table air-hockey game in simulation and optimized the attack-defense strategy of the robot with RL.

Incorporated Prioritized Replay DQN, Dueling DQN, and Noisy Net to improve final performance.  

Introduced an AI to collect positive experience as a warm-up to speed up training, and vectorized the environment’s physical information as an improved embedding to make the sim-to-real transfer easier.

In progress: apply the learned policy to the real robot.

## Physically-based Simulation and Optimization of a two-DOF Chaotic Pendulum ##
*Team Leader, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dec. 2019 - Mar. 2020*

*Supervisor: Genliang CHEN*
* Computed both forward kinematics and inverse kinematics and visualized the motion of a two-DOF chaotic pendulum.
* Implemented genetic algorithm to optimize the structure of the pendulum for long-lived motion.
* Justified the conclusion through manufacturing a scale model.

## Development of Photoelectric 6-DOF Rocker for Robot Teaching
*Research Assistant, Shanghai Jiao Tong University &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sept. 2018 - Apr. 2019*  
* Mastered the basic principle of the photoelectric sensor and determined the overall scheme of 6-dimensional rocker mechanism.
* Wrote communication program and signal test program such as signal receiving and verification.
* Executed motion control experiment of 3D virtual industrial robot which is realized by the six degree of freedom rocker.
