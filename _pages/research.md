## Physically-based Simulation and Optimization of a two-DOF Chaotic Pendulum ##
*Team Leader, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dec. 2019 - Mar. 2020*

*Supervisor: Genliang CHEN*
* Computed both forward kinematics and inverse kinematics and visualized the motion of a two-DOF chaotic pendulum.
* Implemented genetic algorithm to optimize the structure of the pendulum for long-lived motion.
* Justified the conclusion through manufacturing a scale model.
